# AngularProblem4

  We have been introduced to Angular and Jquery this semester.
  
  Angular has a lot of nice features that makes it possible to make well designed dynamic websites.
  With stuff such as data-binding, templates, dependency injection and so forth. It can basically do a lot more than jquery,
  where's jQuery is good at controlling and manipulating DOM elements. Building a webiste, is something Jquery does very well.
  
  Document Object Model,  is a cross-platform and language-independent application programming interface that treats an HTML, XHTML, 
  or XML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. The objects can be manipulated 
  programmatically and any visible changes occurring as a result may then be reflected in the display of the document.
  
  Single Page Application's have a couple of disadvantages and advantages compared to a traditional application.
  
    * No extra queries to the server to download pages
    * Better overview - kind of userfriendly
    * Better performance, only having to load css, js and html once.
